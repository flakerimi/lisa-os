# Architecture Decision Records

Any deviation from `docs/PLAN.md` — a dead library, a changed API, a
superseded model, a better idea — gets an ADR *before* the code changes.
Never silently improvise (PLAN §0.4).

## Process

1. Copy the template below to `NNNN-short-slug.md` (next free number).
2. Status flows: `proposed` → `accepted` → (`superseded by NNNN`).
3. Reference the ADR from commits and the affected component README.

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

- **Status:** proposed | accepted | superseded by NNNN
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What forced a decision.

## Decision
What we chose, stated imperatively.

## Consequences
What gets easier, what gets harder, what we gave up.
```
