//! Prompt-injection red-team corpus + harness (`docs/PLAN.md` §5.10,
//! §5.4 acceptance).
//!
//! The M5 gate: *a hostile string embedded in retrieved content results
//! in 0 unconfirmed privileged calls across 500+ seeded attempts.* The
//! full assertion is two-layered:
//!
//! - **Bus layer (host-independent, shipped here):** every privileged
//!   tool call whose trigger chain carries untrusted provenance must
//!   park for confirmation — the bus dispatches nothing unconfirmed,
//!   regardless of what the model was talked into. This is the
//!   load-bearing guarantee (the bus enforces it, not app goodwill),
//!   and it runs on macOS and Linux with no model or desktop.
//! - **Model-in-the-loop layer (deferred, ADR-0009):** feed each
//!   hostile payload through the real system prompt + a resident model
//!   and assert the *plan* it emits, then run that plan through this
//!   same bus. Needs inferenced + a model; wired when the MCP transport
//!   and overlay-as-Agent-client land.
//!
//! This crate generates the corpus (hostile payload × injection vector
//! × target privileged tool × provenance source) and drives it through
//! a real `AgentBus` with a recording dispatcher. It is a library so
//! the gate test and future model-in-the-loop tests share one corpus.
